## Using <canvas> to mask/threshold images

I am using a similar methodology to my *Pixator* app to threshold an image in grayscale based on the slider value on the screen.  I want to be able to take images of text and threshold the text out from the background so that the text is much clearer than the original image.  I could have done this in MATLAB, but I wanted to give myself an exercise to solely do it with JavaScript.  Testing ideas with `<canvas>` outside of the *Pixator* codebase also allows me to workshop new potential features to add to the editor.
